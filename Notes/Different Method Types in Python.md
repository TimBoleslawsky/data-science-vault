In Python, **instance methods**, **static methods**, and **class methods** are available methods that can be defined within a class, but they differ in how they operate and what they act upon.
## Instance Methods
- **Definition**: An instance method is a method that operates on an instance of a class. It takes `self` as its first parameter, which is a reference to the specific instance of the class that the method is being called on.
- **When to Use**: You use instance methods when you need to access or modify the data stored in specific instances of a class.

 Example:

``` python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, speed):
        self.brand = brand
        self.speed = speed

    # Instance method
    def accelerate(self, increase):
        self.speed += increase
        return f"The {self.brand} is now going {self.speed} mph."

# Creating an instance of Car
my_car = Car("Toyota", 60)
print(my_car.accelerate(10))  # Outputs: The Toyota is now going 70 mph.
```

## Static Methods
- **Definition**: A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than any specific instance of the class. It does not take `self` or `cls` as its first parameter and, therefore, cannot access instance-specific data (via `self`) or class-specific data (via `cls`).
- **When to use**: Static methods are used for utility functions that are related to the class but don’t need to access or modify class/instance data. They are often used as helper methods within a class.
- **Why you use it**: Reasons for using static methods include: Clarity, Reusability without having to instantiate an object of the class, Efficiency, ...

Example:

``` python
class MathOperations:
    # Static method
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

# Using static method
result = MathOperations.add(5, 10)
print(result)  # Outputs: 15
```

## Class Methods
- **Definition**: In addition to instance and static methods, Python also has **class methods**, which operate at the class level and can access class-specific data. They take `cls` as their first parameter and are often used for factory methods or operations that affect the class as a whole.
- **When to use**: When you need to access or modify class-level data (i.e., data shared among all instances).

Example:

``` python
class Car:
    number_of_cars = 0

    def __init__(self, brand, speed):
        self.brand = brand
        self.speed = speed
        Car.number_of_cars += 1

    # Class method
    @classmethod
    def get_number_of_cars(cls):
        return f"There are {cls.number_of_cars} cars."

# Creating instances of Car
car1 = Car("Toyota", 60)
car2 = Car("Honda", 70)

print(Car.get_number_of_cars())  # Outputs: There are 2 cars.
```
