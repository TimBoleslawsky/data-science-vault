Data visualization is a great tool for exploratory data analysis, error detection, and communication, ... We want to keep six basic principles in mind when it comes to data visualization. For visualization tools look here: [[Visualization Tools]]
## Maximizing Data-Ink Ratio / Minimizing Chartjunk
The Data-Ink Ratio is defined by the *Data-Ink* (so the part of the graphic that actually represents the data) in relation to the *total ink used in graphic*. We want to let the data do the talking and minimize unnecessary ink. 
## Minimizing the Lie Factor
It is very possible to show true data but still (deliberately) mislead your audience. The lie factor is defined as the *size of an effect in the graphic* in relation to the *size of the effect in the data*. Some good practices to minimize the lie factor include:
- Include the variance when presenting a mean value. 
- Present the actual data points when plotting regression lines.
- Choose an appropriate scale that represents the data truthfully. 
## Proper Scaling and Labeling
Besides contributing to the lie factor, poorly chosen scaling and labeling can make a graph unreadable. Choose scales and labels so that the data fills out the allotted space on the chart but not more.
## Effective Use of Color and Shading
Good ideas when working with color are:
- Distinguish between classes and encoding of numerical values in charts.
- Color different kinds of entities differently if present in the same plot.
- Use colors that have inherent meaning, if possible, e.g., losses with red, environmental causes with green, etc.
## The Power of Repetition
Small multiple plots and tables are excellent ways to represent multivariate data.
