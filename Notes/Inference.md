To make an inference is to basically reach a conclusion based on some evidence. We have a few ways we can do this. We can do this for example via [[Basics of Probability and Statistics for Data Science|inferential statistics]] based on descriptive statistics or via hypothesis testing. But we can also use regression to reach these conclusions, more on that here: [[Inference and Regression]].

(It needs to be said that the following are Frequentist approaches. For more on the difference between Frequentist and Bayesian approaches look here: [[Two Approaches to Statistics]]. For more on Bayesian inference look here: [[Bayesian Inference]]).

For a general guideline on when to use which of these three approaches, we can follow this: 
- When estimation is the goal → Use Inferential Statistics.
- When testing a claim → Use Hypothesis Testing.
- When understanding relationships and making predictions → Use Regression.
## Hypothesis Testing
To answer questions in a data driven manner we can use hypothesis testing. The basics of hypothesis testing and how it differs from descriptive statistics are summarized here: [[Hypothesis Testing]]
	- For different use-cases there are different hypothesis tests. More on that here: [[Different Types of Hypothesis Tests]].
	- An important part of performing hypothesis tests, especially in the case of [[Clinical Trails|clinical trails]], is [[Sample Size Calculation|sample size calculation]].
	- To perform hypothesis tests we adhere to the [[Hypothesis Testing Process|hypothesis testing process]].
	- And to evaluate hypothesis tests we use the [[Metrics of Hypothesis Tests|metrics of hypothesis tests]].
## Meta Analysis
When we want to infer some knowledge from more than one source (study, article, ...) we can use meta analysis. Here is how we do that: [[Meta Analysis]]
