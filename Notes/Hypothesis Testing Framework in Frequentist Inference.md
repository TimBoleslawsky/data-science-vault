The hypothesis testing framework used in frequentist inference described here 
([[Inference#Frequentist Inference]]) is pretty standardize. Although in practice this leads to a lot of misuse in statistical analysis, it is still helpful to have a backlog of pre-define tests and a common process.
- For different use-cases there are different hypothesis tests. More on that here: [[Different Types of Hypothesis Tests]].
- To perform hypothesis tests we adhere to the [[Hypothesis Testing Process|hypothesis testing process]].
- And to evaluate hypothesis tests we use the [[Metrics of Hypothesis Tests|metrics of hypothesis tests]].
- An important part of performing hypothesis tests, especially in the case of [[Clinical Trails|clinical trails]], is [[Sample Size Calculation|sample size calculation]].
