After the initial setup, the number of options for improving a neural network can be overwhelming. Optimization is a multi-dimensional process, and there’s no single right path, but a structured approach can reduce chaos and guide your decisions. Here’s a general priority-based guideline for optimizing a neural network:

**1.  Baseline Model and Sanity Check**
- **Goal:** Ensure your model can learn and your pipeline works.
- Use a small dataset to **overfit** a few samples — it should reach near 100% accuracy.
- Keep architecture and training simple.
- Use standard settings (e.g., ReLU, Adam, CrossEntropyLoss, fixed LR).

**2. Data Quality and Preprocessing**
- **Clean your data:** Remove noise, fix labels, balance classes.
- **Normalize / standardize** inputs properly (e.g., mean/std for images).
- If applicable, consider resizing, cropping, or fixing image aspect ratios.

**3. Model Design**
- Choose a **simple architecture** first. Add complexity gradually.
- If applicable, start with a known good architecture (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).

**4. Learning Rate and Optimizer**
- **Tune the learning rate** first — it’s the most critical hyperparameter.
	- Use LR finder or try a small LR grid search.
- Start with **Adam** or **SGD with momentum**.
- Only try more exotic optimizers later (e.g., AdamW, Ranger).

**5. Training Dynamics Monitoring**
- Use TensorBoard or logging for:
	- Training & validation loss curves
	- Accuracy over time
	- LR schedule visualization
- Look for **overfitting** (validation loss goes up while training loss decreases).

**6. Regularization Techniques**
- If overfitting:
	- Add **data augmentation**
	- Add **Dropout** or **weight decay**
	- Try **batch norm** (if not already used)

**7. Learning Rate Scheduling**
- If loss plateaus or overfits:
	- Use schedulers: ReduceLROnPlateau, CosineAnnealing, StepLR, or OneCycle.
	- Dynamic LR changes often unlock training improvements.

**8. Architecture Improvements**
- Now consider:
	- Adding layers / filters
	- Using **residual connections**
	- Trying **attention mechanisms**
	- Switching to a more advanced architecture

**9. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Once the model pipeline is solid:
	- Tune batch size, optimizer parameters, LR schedule settings.
	- Use Optuna, Ray Tune, or grid/random search.

Here are a few basic question we can ask ourselves:
1. **Is the model underfitting?**
	→ Try deeper model, lower regularization, longer training, higher LR.
2. **Is the model overfitting?**
	→ Add regularization, data augmentation, dropout, early stopping.
3. **Is the training slow or unstable?**
	→ Tune learning rate, use a better scheduler, normalize data.
4. **Is the validation performance stagnant?**
	→ Tune architecture, try pre-trained models, or change data strategy.
