Clinical trails are a major part of the [[Drug Development Cycle|drug development cycle]], especially the clinical development. More on the design of clinical trails can be found here: [[Design of Clinical Trails]]

*A Clinical trial is a research activity that involves the administration of a test **treatment** to some **experimental unit** in order to **evaluate** the treatment.
- Treatment: any intervention to be evaluated in human subjects (placebo, new drug, diet, medical device, ...).
- Experimental unit: usually patients with certain diseases at certain stages and/or healthy human subjects.
- Evaluation: mainly the assessment of clinical effect, but also safety, quality of live, ...

When talking about clinical trails, we can differentiate between two variants:
## Randomized Controlled Trails (RCT)
Randomized controlled trails are based on three key principles: 
- Randomization (more [[Design of Clinical Trails#Randomization|here]]) -- generation of sequence of treatment assignments by means of some known random mechanism (e.g. by coin flip) => helps mitigate various experimental biases; promote "comparability" of treatment groups; can form the basis for statistical inference;
	- Help mitigate **selection bias**: The use of randomization can avoid subjective assignment of treatments to patients who participate in clinical trials.
	- Help mitigate **chronological bias**: Patients enrolled early may differ from patients enrolled later.
- Blinding (more [[Design of Clinical Trails#Blinding|here]]) -- a process that attempts to keep the treatment assignments not known or easily ascertained => helps mitigate ascertainment bias (systematic distortions due to the knowledge of which intervention the patient is receiving)
- Use of control group -- a group of patients treated with a “standard of care”, which serves as the reference for treatment comparisons.
## Observational Studies
Studies where data is collected for a set of patients without any randomization. There are two types of observational studies: 
- Prospective: data is collected after the objectives are set.  
- Retrospective: data is collected before the objectives are set.

Observational studies can be used to test the external validity of RCTs by expanding the settings to a  more representative population; to formulate hypotheses for RCTs to test; to help establish the appropriate sample size for an RCT; ...
