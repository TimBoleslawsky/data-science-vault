Multiple regression extends simple regression to more than one predictor. There are a few reasons why we would want to do this: 

First is obviously *multiple causation*. If we want to capture a phenomenon that arises from multiple causes, we need multiple predictors. Also measurement of each cause is useful, so when we can use the same data to estimate more than one type of influence, we should. 

Second is, that we can *control for confounders*, unmasked masked relationships, and argue about other causal pitfalls. More on these here: [[Causal Inference]]. 

Third, *interactions*. The importance of one variable may depend upon another. For example, plants benefit from both light and water. But in the absence of either, the other is no benefit at all. Such interactions occur very often. Effective inference about one variable will often depend upon consideration of others. More on interactions, here: [[Interaction Modelling]].
