## Cartesian Product of Sets
*When two se­ts have items in them, A and B, the­ir Cartesian product is all the pairs you can make. One­ part of the pair comes from set A. The­ other part comes from set B. We­ make every possible­ pair this way. The result is a new se­t of all these pairs. This set is a set of **ordered pairs.** 
We write­ this new set as A×B.
**A × B = {(a, b) : a ∈ A and b ∈ B}**

Example: 
- Let A = {1, 2} and B = {4, 5, 6}
- A × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)}
## Power Sets
𝒫 𝐴 = {𝑋 ∣ 𝑋 ⊆ 𝐴} is the power set of 𝐴, the power set contains all subset of $A$.

Example: 
- 𝒫 ({{𝑎, 𝑏} , 𝑐}) = {∅, {𝑎, 𝑏}, 𝑐, {{𝑎, 𝑏} , 𝑐}}
