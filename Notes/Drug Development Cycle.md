Within the drug development cycle there are five stages:
- **Drug discovery and laboratory development** 
- **Preclinical studies** (usually animal) 
- **Clinical development**
- **Regulatory review**
- **Post-marketing monitoring**

Two major parties are involved in clinical trails:
- **Sponsor**: 
	- takes responsibility for and initiates a clinical investigation. 
	- may be an individual or pharmaceutical company, governmental agency, academic institution, private organization, or other organization. 
	- does not actually conduct the investigation unless the sponsor is a sponsor-investigator.
- **Investigator**:
	- actually conducts a clinical investigation (i.e., under whose immediate direction the drug is administered or dispensed to a subject). 
## Clinical Development
The key component of the clinical research and development is to **scientifically evaluate the benefits and risks** of promising pharmaceutical entities **at a minimal cost**. To ensure this, we use something called a clinical development plan (CDP).

Clinical development has four phases:
- Phase I: Human pharmacology
	- 50-150 participants (usually healthy volunteers).  
	- to assess safety and tolerability.  
	- to define/describe:
		- Pharmacokinetics (PK), i.e. what the body does to the drug;  
		- Pharmacodynamics (PD), i.e. what the drug does to the body.  
		- to explore drug metabolism and interactions.  
		- Single and repeated doses (SAD and MAD).
- Phase II: Therapeutic exploratory â€“ proof-of-concept (PhIIa)/dose-finding studies (PhIIb)
	- 100-200 participants (patients) .  
	- to assess safety and tolerability in patients.  
	- to explore drug use in the targeted indication.  
	- to calibrate dose regimens.
- Phase III: Therapeutic confirmatory
	- 500-1500 patients.  
	- to demonstrate/confirm efficacy.  
	- to establish safety profile.  
	- to assess benefit/risk.  
	- to measure interactions between drugs.
- Phase IV: Therapeutic use
	- population of patients.  
	- to refine understanding of benefit/risk.  
	- to refine dosing.  
	- to identify less common adverse reactions.  
	- marketing.
