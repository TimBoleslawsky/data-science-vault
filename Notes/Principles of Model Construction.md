TBD

Absolutely ‚Äî those three categories are central, but they‚Äôre often thrown around loosely. Let me give you a **careful breakdown** that clarifies their meaning, mathematical footing, and role in the taxonomy we built.

---

## **1. Parametric modeling**

**Core idea:** Assume a fixed, finite set of parameters defines the model.

- **Definition:**
	
	- The form of the function/distribution is specified in advance (e.g., linear, logistic, Gaussian).
		
	- Number of parameters does **not grow with the dataset size**.
		
	- Example: linear regression with parameters \theta = (w_1, w_2, b).

- **Mathematical form:**
	
	- y = f_\theta(x), where \theta is finite-dimensional.
		
	- Or, in probabilistic form: p(y|x; \theta).

- **Examples:**
	
	- Linear regression, logistic regression
		
	- ARIMA time series models
		
	- Gaussian mixture models (with fixed number of components)

- **Strengths:**
	
	- Simple, interpretable.
		
	- Efficient with small data.
		
	- Easy inference (MLE, MAP, Bayesian posteriors).

- **Weaknesses:**
	
	- Strong assumptions may be too restrictive.
		
	- Can underfit complex patterns.

## **2. Nonparametric modeling**

**Core idea:** Flexibility ‚Äî the model complexity grows with the data.

- **Definition:**
	
	- ‚ÄúNonparametric‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúno parameters,‚Äù but rather ‚Äúno fixed number of parameters.‚Äù
		
	- The effective number of parameters increases with the dataset size.
		
	- The function space is very large, allowing very flexible fits.

- **Mathematical form:**
	
	- Instead of assuming a fixed family f_\theta, we assume a broad function space.
		
	- Examples:
		
		- Kernel density estimation (all data points contribute to the density).
			
		- Gaussian processes (f(x) is modeled as a distribution over functions).

- **Examples:**
	
	- k-nearest neighbors
		
	- Kernel methods (e.g., support vector machines with RBF kernel)
		
	- Gaussian processes
		
	- Dirichlet processes (Bayesian nonparametrics)

- **Strengths:**
	
	- Very flexible; fewer assumptions about true data-generating process.
		
	- Can approximate very complex functions.

- **Weaknesses:**
	
	- Data-hungry.
		
	- Computationally expensive (training scales poorly with dataset size).
		
	- Harder to interpret.

## **3. Algorithmic modeling**

**Core idea:** Focus on predictive performance through algorithms, not necessarily explicit statistical assumptions.

- **Definition:**
	
	- Term popularized by Breiman (2001, ‚ÄúStatistical Modeling: The Two Cultures‚Äù).
		
	- Rather than starting from a probabilistic generative assumption, models are defined **procedurally** (through an algorithm) to map inputs to outputs.
		
	- No explicit likelihood or closed-form model of p(x,y).

- **Examples:**
	
	- Decision trees
		
	- Random forests
		
	- Gradient boosting machines
		
	- Many deep learning models (though some can be cast probabilistically)

- **Strengths:**
	
	- High predictive accuracy.
		
	- Flexible and adaptable (ensembles, deep nets).
		
	- Often robust to messy real-world data.

- **Weaknesses:**
	
	- May lack interpretability (black-box).
		
	- No explicit probability model ‚Üí harder to use for classical inference.
		
	- Risk of overfitting without careful regularization.

## **‚úÖ Placement in the Big Picture**

- These three describe **how you specify the model class** in **Step 2: Model Construction**.
	
- You can think of them as **philosophies of model building**:
	
	- **Parametric:** fixed assumptions, compact representation.
		
	- **Nonparametric:** flexible representation, adapts with data.
		
	- **Algorithmic:** procedure-based, often prediction-driven rather than distribution-driven.

---

üìå A neat summary:

- **Parametric = theory-driven (compact form, small parameter set).**
	
- **Nonparametric = data-driven (complex form grows with data).**
	
- **Algorithmic = prediction-driven (procedures, not explicit probability models).**

Would you like me to **connect these three to your other ‚Äúmodel type‚Äù distinctions** (e.g., parametric models are often linear + descriptive; nonparametric often nonlinear + probabilistic; algorithmic often nonlinear + black box), so you can see how they interact?
