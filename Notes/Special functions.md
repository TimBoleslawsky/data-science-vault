## Function Composition
Suppose $𝑓 ∶ 𝐴→𝐵$ and $𝑔 ∶ 𝐵→𝐶$, so the codomain of 𝑓 equals the domain of $𝑔$ 
- Then $𝑔 ∘ 𝑓 ∶ 𝐴 → 𝐶$ is the composition of 𝑓 with $𝑔$, defined as $𝑔 ∘ 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑔(𝑓(𝑥))$  
- That is, 𝑥 is first mapped by 𝑓, then by $𝑔$

## Inverse Functions
A function 𝑓 ∶ 𝐴 → 𝐵 is bijective if and only if the  
inverse relation $𝑓^{-1}$ is a function from 𝐵 to 𝐴  
• If 𝑓 ∶ 𝐴 → 𝐵 is bijective, then its inverse is the function $𝑓^{-1}$ ∶ 𝐵 → 𝐴.

Example: 
The function 𝑓 ∶ ℝ → ℝ defined as $𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥^2 + 1$ is bijective.  
We can find its inverse by writing $𝑦 = 𝑥^2 + 1$, exchange 𝑦 and 𝑥, and solve for 𝑦, which yields 
$𝑦 = \sqrt{𝑥 − 1}$. Therefore $𝑓^{-1}(𝑥) = \sqrt{𝑥 − 1}$.
