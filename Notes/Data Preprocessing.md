In this note we discuss some of the most important activities commonly considered part of data preprocessing.
## Data Encoding
Data encoding helps us with dealing with categorical features. More on that and useful methods, here: [[Data Encoding]].
## Handling Imbalanced Classes
Handling imbalanced classes is important to ensure proper evaluation of models and is a common problem in especially classification. More here: [[Handling Imbalanced Classes]].
## Transformation, Normalization, and Scaling
Transformation, normalization, and scaling help us with some of the issues that arise in preprocessing when dealing with data and models that are based on data: [[Data Transformation and Scaling]].
## Feature Engineering
Under feature engineering we usually understand a few aspects. They are described as follows:
- Feature extraction, deriving new features from raw data, often from unstructured formats (e.g., images, text, audio). Especially important in unsupervised learning.
- [[Feature Selection]], picking a subset of existing features based on some criteria (e.g., relevance, redundancy). Primarily used in supervised learning.
- Feature construction, creating new features from existing ones by combining or transforming them.
- Dimensionality reduction, projecting high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving structure or variance.
