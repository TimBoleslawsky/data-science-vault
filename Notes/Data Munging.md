*In data science, **data munging** (also called **data wrangling**) is the process of transforming “raw” data into a more useful format. 
 
Data munging involves:
- Collecting data: finding the appropriate data sets and understanding the data sets at hand  
- Cleaning: ensuring consistent formatting of data, removing outliers, dealing with missing values  
- Restructuring/ Structuring: organizing the data, especially turning unstructured data into structured data. This might include merging or concatenating datasets, splitting columns, ...
- Validating: ensure consistency of data by applying rules, such as cross-checking different fields  
- Publishing: provide the dataset to the users for further processing, document the origin of the data and the transformations that were applied  
## Collecting Data
Collection data first requires asking the correct questions. Who might have the data I need?, Why might they make it available to me?, ...

The actual data resources can be: 
- company data, government data, academic data, ... (hunting)
- logging of for example IoT devices (logging)
- Web scraping consists of the following
	- Spidering is the process of downloading the right set of pages for analysis  
	- Scraping is the stripping of the interesting content from each such page

Another possible step here could be data annotation. It may be necessary to annotate data for further classification for example. The main consideration is between cost/effort and data quality.
## Data Cleaning
Important: Data cleaning is always done on a copy of the original data, ideally by a pipeline that makes changes in a systematic and repeatable way!

High-quality data needs to satisfy several criteria, including  
- Validity: data must meet certain constraints, such as type of data, range of values, uniqueness of keys, and cross-field validity (such that values in different fields of the record are in agreement)  
- Accuracy: Accuracy refers to how closely the data reflects the true value or reality it is meant to represent.
- Completeness: data must contain all required values or measures  
- Consistency: data should be in agreement with equivalent data from other systems  
- Uniformity: data should be formatted the same way, and the values of fields should be interpretable in the same way, e.g., by using same units  
	=> All of these criteria may be impossible to achieve, and data cleaning cannot repair all deficiencies in the data  
### Errors vs. Artifacts
An error is a fundamental loss of information during data acquisition  
- Example: Logs lost because of a system crash is an error that cannot be recovered

Artifacts are systematic problems from the construction of the data  
- Artifacts can often be corrected from the raw data  
- Artifacts must be detected before they are corrected: if we don’t know of them, we can’t fix them  
- Example: Analysis of the scientific publications shows two spikes, in 1960 and in 2001. The spike in 1960 makes sense (here the documentation for scientific publications began) but it seems weird to have a spike in 2001. After further analysis, we can see, that in 2001 the naming convention changed and therefore many scientists were categorized as "new".
=> Always be suspicious of whether your data is clean enough to trust!
### Data Compatibility
“Apples to apples” vs. “apples to oranges”: values in a field should have the same interpretation for all records.

Some examples: 
- Unit conversions, beware of values in different units (e.g., meters vs. feet)
- Numerical representation, numbers can be stored in many different ways with benefits and drawbacks. 
- Names, names can have a variety of forms. Some workaround would be a personal number.
- Times and dates, timezones or daylight saving times can make things difficult.
- Money, currency conversions can make things difficult.
### Missing Values
Replacing missing values willy-nilly with a 0 or a -1 is dangerous. Zero can be a valid value and it is then impossible to tell whether it is a missing value or an actual 0. Because handling missing values is a very important and nuanced topic, I discuss it in another note, here: [[Handling Missing Values]].
### Outliers
An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations.
Outliers can be caused by:
- Mistakes in data entry (e.g., mistakes when performing measurements, or simply entering the data incorrectly by a human being)  
- Mistakes in algorithmic data collection, like errors when scraping data from the web  
- Sometimes the outliers are just valid albeit rare data points  
- ...

Outliers can be detected by:
- General sanity checking (if a child is recorded as being -2 km tall, the record is probably erroneous)  
- Visual inspection by plotting the values and seeing if some data points strike out  
- Statistical checking, such as if the data is normally distributed, then finding a point that is more than 3 standard deviations away is suspicious (remember the 66-95-99.7 rule)  

As outliers are often the result of systematic errors, one should aim to erase the process  
that produces such outliers than just drop the outliers!
## Inter-Annotator Agreements
A major bottleneck (mainly for classification tasks) is the annotation of the data. If we have more than one annotator, we may investigate the quality of the annotation by comparing the annotations to each other: the inter-annotator agreement. 

In practice we can use the chance-corrected agreement measures: **Cohen’s $\kappa$**. We do this by estimating a chance agreement probability $P(e)$: if the two annotators were completely independent, what is the chance that they agree? Comparing this to the estimated probability of agreement $P(a)$ gives us this formula for $\kappa$: $\kappa=  \frac{P(a)-P(e)}{1-P(e)}$. 

A typical interpretation for $\kappa$ is: $\kappa = 1$: perfect agreement; $\kappa = 0$: agreement no better than random; $\kappa < 0$: worse than chance. If $\kappa$ is low, we need to acknowledge this. Either by being transparent about this or by reevaluating our annotation methods and criteria. 

In Python we can do this like this: 

``` python
from statsmodels.stats.inter_rater import cohens_kappa
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Inter-Annotator Agreement

rating_table = confusion_matrix(crowdsource_train["sentiment"], gold_train["sentiment"])

kappa = cohens_kappa(rating_table)
```
