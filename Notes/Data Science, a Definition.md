## Data Science is an Interdisciplinary Science
Data Science lies at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and substantive application domains. 
- From computer science comes machine learning and high-performance computing technologies for dealing with scale. 
- From statistics comes a long tradition of exploratory data analysis, significance testing, and visualization. 
- From application domains in business and the sciences come challenges worthy of battle, and evaluation standards to assess when they have been adequately conquered.

### What Do We Need Data Science For?

- New technology leads to the amassing of a lot of data.
- Computing advances make it possible (even for the little guy, see cloud computing) to analyze data in novel ways and at ever-increasing scales. 
- Success stories applying data to diverse areas bring data science to a large popular audience.
## Data Science vs. Computer Science

- answer questions with insight derived from data vs. method-driven
- results that describe the world (and the business needs) vs. only worry about the correctness of the output  
- Data scientists have to worry about robustness in the face of noisy and erroneous data  
- sufficient precision, the meaning of a number is important vs. well-defined problems, precise, and correct numbers
- are hired to produce insight vs. are hired to build a system

Two main questions interest us as Data Scientists:
- Given a problem, what available data will help us answer it? 
- Given a data set, what interesting problems can we apply it to?
## Basic Problems of Data Science

- **Classification** aims to give discrete labels to items 
	- Is the given email spam or ham?  
	- Is the tumor in the image malignant or benign?  
	- Which species of flower is described in the input?  
	- ...
- **Regression** aims to predict numerical quantities based on observations at some point outside the dataset
	-   Given the description of a house (e.g., age, size,  location), what is its market value (at what price would it be sold)?  
	- Given the description of a country (e.g., GDP, healthcare spending, etc.), what is the life expectancy in the country?
	- ...
