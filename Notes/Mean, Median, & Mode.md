## Mean
The mean is split into the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean, and the harmonic mean.
### Arithmetic Mean
The arithmetic mean means we sum the values and divide them by the number of observations. This is also more commonly known as the average. The mean is best used to characterize symmetric distributions (the number of items above the mean should be roughly the same as the number below) without outliers, especially in the direction of infinity. 
### Geometric Mean
The geometric mean is the nth root of the product of n values. The geometric mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean and is very sensitive to outliers in the direction of zero. We want to use the geometric mean for ratios or other things multiplicative or exponential.
### Harmonic Mean
The harmonic mean is a type of average that is best suited for rates or ratios, particularly when you want to emphasize the influence of smaller values. It is particularly useful when averaging things like speeds or rates, where you’re concerned with the rate over time or distance.
## Median
The median is the exact middle value among a data set; just as many elements lie above the median as below it. The median generally proves to be a useful statistic for skewed distributions or data with outliers.
## Mode
The mode is the most frequent element in the data set. Because the mode often isn’t close to the center, it is rarely of use except for categorical data.
