Descriptive statistics is used to describe a sample. What type of descriptive statistics we can use, is dependent on the [[Data#Data Types|data type]]. 
## Descriptive Statistics for Categorical Data
Descriptive statistics for categorical data can be categorized into frequency measures and proportion-based measures.

**Frequency Measures**
These describe how often each category appears in the data:
- **Count (sometimes also frequency)**: The number of observations in each category. 
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring category.
  Example: If category B appears most often, it is the mode.

**Proportion-Based Measures**
These describe the relative distribution of categories:
- **Proportion**: The fraction of the total observations that fall into each category.
- **Percentages**: Proportions expressed as percentages.
## Descriptive Statistics for Numerical Data
We have two types of measures for numerical data in descriptive statistics:
- [[Mean, Median, & Mode|Central tendency measures]], capture the center around which the data is distributed.
- [[Variation or Variability Measures|Variation or variability measures]], describe the data spread, i.e. how far the measurements lie from the center.
- We also have *Order Statistics* like minimum and maximum, and percentiles, deciles, quartiles, and quantiles. This is not really its own category (because the median would also be an order statistic) but more of a broader grouping.

Sometimes [[Covariance & Correlation|correlation analysis]] is also mentioned as descriptive statistic when talking about numerical data. 
## Descriptive Statistics vs. Probability Distribution
Descriptive analysis is limited to the existing sample - it is not designed for describing unseen data (the whole population). For that we need to use [[Distribution|probability distributions]].
