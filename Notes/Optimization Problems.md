Optimization problems can be seen as an extension of constraint satisfaction problems. Here the goal is not only feasibility, but also optimality. 

Optimization problems are problems that demand some form of maximization or minimization to get to an optimal solution. We use **mathematical programming** to solve these problems. The structure of these problems is always the same and can be summarized like this: 
- **Objective function**: This is the function to be optimized (minimized or maximized).
- **Constraints**: Conditions that the solution must satisfy, often represented as equations or inequalities.
- **Variables**: The input unknowns that can be changed to change the value of the objective function. 

Because the objective function, constraints, and variables can be linear, non-linear, integer ... we divide mathematical programming into different subgroups. The most important are: **linear programming**, **non-linear programming**, and **integer programming**.
