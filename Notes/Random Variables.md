A random variable is something that can take different outcomes based on chance. Random variables are a way of mapping the outcomes of an experiment into numerical values: 𝑋 ∶ Ω → 𝑆.
- The random variable: $X$
- The possible outcomes: Ω
- The numerical values that the outcomes are mapped into: $S$. 
	- If 𝑆 is countable we say 𝑋 is **discrete**. This means $X$ takes a specific value like the number of heads when flipping a coin. When looking at data types, discrete random variables can be categorical data or discrete numerical data.
	- If 𝑆 is uncountably infinite, we say 𝑋 is **continuous**. This means $X$ can take any value within a range, like the height of a person. When looking at data types, contiunous random variables are continuous numerical data.
