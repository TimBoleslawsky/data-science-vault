## Definition
Let 𝐴 = {1,2,3,4,6}  
- Let the relation 𝑎𝑅𝑏 express that 𝑎 ∣ 𝑏, that is, 𝑎 divides 𝑏  
- 𝑅 = { (1,1) , (1,2) , (1,3) , (1,4) , (1,5) , (1,6) , (2,2) , (2,4) , (2,6) , (3,3) , (3,6) , (4,4) , (6,6) }  
- The relation 𝑅 is reflexive if 𝑥𝑅𝑥 for every 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴. This relation is reflexive.
- The relation 𝑅 is symmetric if 𝑥𝑅𝑦 implies 𝑦𝑅𝑥 for all 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝐴. This relation is not symmetric.
- The relation 𝑅 is transitive if whenever 𝑥𝑅𝑦 and 𝑦𝑅𝑧, then also 𝑥𝑅𝑧. This relation is transitive.
Example:
Let 𝐴 = {1,2,3,4,6}  
• Let the relation 𝑎𝑅𝑏 express that 𝑎 ∣ 𝑏, that is, 𝑎 divides 𝑏  
• 𝑅 = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,2), (2,4), (2,6), (3,3), (3,6), (4,4), (6,6)}
- The relation is reflexive because we have (1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(6,6).
- The relation is not symmetric because E.g. have (1,2) but not (2,1).
- The relation is transitive because E.g. we have (1,2) and (2,4) and (1,4) holds.
## Equivalence Relations
A relation 𝑅 on a set 𝐴 is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
Example: 
- 𝑅 = { 5𝑥 + 𝑖, 5𝑦 + 𝑖 ∣ 𝑖 ∈ {0,1,2,3,4} , 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ ℤ} or {(x,y) ∈ ℤ ∣ x - y is divisible by 5}
	- (0,0) ∈ 𝑅  
	- (3,3) ∈ 𝑅  
	- (0,15) ∈ 𝑅  
	- (0,1) ∉ 𝑅
- The relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive  

Given an equivalence relation, 𝑅 on 𝐴, the equivalence class containing 𝑎 is the subset of all  
elements related to 𝑎, often denoted \[𝑎] => That is, \[𝑎] = {𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∣ 𝑥𝑅𝑎}
- Equivalence classes for $R$: 0 = {... , −10, −5,0,5,10, ... }, 1 = {... , −9, −4,1,6,11, ... }, 2 = {... , −8, −3,2,7,12, ... }, 3 = {... , −7, −2,3,8,13, ... }, 4 = {... , −6, −1,4,9,14, ... }
