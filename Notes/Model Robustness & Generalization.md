The **robustness** of the model is defined as the ability to handle unexpected or noisy inputs, including small changes in data distribution.
The **generalization** of the model is defined as the ability to perform well on truly unseen data, not just the training/validation/test set.

Here are some methods that help with this: 
- [[Regularization]], implicit as well as explicit regularization.
- [[Ensemble Models]]
- Cross-Validation, more here: [[Final Model Evaluation]]
