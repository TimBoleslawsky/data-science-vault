Data-centric AI is an approach that focuses on improving the quality, consistency, and relevance of the data used to train machine learning models, rather than focusing primarily on the model architecture or algorithms.

Hereâ€™s a direct comparison:

**Data-centric AI:**
- Emphasizes improving and curating datasets.
- Includes data engineering in the ML-workflow to enhance the workflow in each step (collect data, train model, ...)
- Assumes that the model is fixed or mostly adequate.
- Targets label accuracy, data consistency, class balance, and coverage.
- Shows promise in improving model performance more than model-centric AI.

**Model-centric AI:**
- Emphasizes improving model architectures, algorithms, and hyperparameters.
- Assumes that the data is fixed and sufficient.
- Involves experimenting with different neural networks, optimization techniques, or regularization strategies.
- Common in academic research or benchmark challenges where clean datasets are given.

In practice, both approaches are often combined, but data-centric AI is gaining traction as the key to scaling robust AI systems, especially when model performance plateaus with better architectures.
