## Data Types
Data types are the basic distinction between how our data can look. This is very important, when looking at distribution of data or visualization of data and is a cornerstone to a lot of following approaches. 

**Categorical data**: labels, tags
- Nominal data: not ordered labels
- Ordinal data: ordered labels

**Numerical data**: numbers
- Discrete (interval) data: countable values 
- Continuous (ratio) data: uncountable values
## Properties of Data
Besides the data type, we have two other properties of data, that are interesting for use. The quantity and the structure. 

**Big data** is (often unstructured) data that is too large for convenient processing because of its volume, multiple sources, automatic generation, etc.
**Little data** is not necessarily any worse for answering the right question if the dataset is correct.

**Structured data** is in a well-defined, standardized format that is easy to manipulate algorithmically, such as a spreadsheet or a table in a database.
**Unstructured data** is poorly defined and is not organized in a pre-defined manner, such as raw text documents, images, videos, etc.
