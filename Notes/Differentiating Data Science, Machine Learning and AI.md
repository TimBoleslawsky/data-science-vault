**Data Science**: An interdisciplinary field that combines statistical analysis, programming, domain knowledge, and data processing to *extract meaningful insights and patterns from raw data*.
=> **Goal**: Understand and analyze real-world phenomena through data to inform decision-making or build predictive models.

**Artificial Intelligence**: AI is the broadest concept that focuses on *creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence*. This includes reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and understanding language.
=> **Goal**: Mimic or simulate human intelligence to automate tasks, make decisions, or solve complex problems.

**Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that focuses on algorithms and models that allow computers to *learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data*, without being explicitly programmed for every specific task. This is how ML is different from data analysis. We have an automated process and the computer program is learnt from data. 
=> **Goal**: Enable systems to improve their performance over time with experience (data).
## How Do They Relate?
Basically it comes down to this: 
- AI encompasses ML, which is one of its primary techniques!
- Data Science often uses ML as a tool for model creation but is not limited to it!
